# React Test Task

## Implemented bonus functionality:

1.	Calculation between last two requests and add visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices (based on change percent)
2.	Added possibility to switch on/off tickers by user
3.	Added time conversion to local (not sure if it worked out right)
